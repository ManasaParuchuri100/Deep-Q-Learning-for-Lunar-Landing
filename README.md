# Deep-Q-Learning-for-Lunar-Landing
This project focuses on using Deep Q-Learning (DQL) to teach an AI agent how to control a spacecraft and perform a successful lunar landing. The simulation is built in Gymnasium's LunarLander-v2 environment, which replicates real-world physics to create a challenging and realistic scenario.
