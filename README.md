# Deep-Q-Learning-for-Lunar-Landing
This project focuses on using Deep Q-Learning (DQL) to teach an AI agent how to control a spacecraft and perform a successful lunar landing. The simulation is built in Gymnasium's LunarLander-v2 environment, which replicates real-world physics to create a challenging and realistic scenario.

# Key Components:
Environment:

The project uses Gymnasium's LunarLander-v2 environment, which is a 2D physics simulation representing the dynamics of a lunar lander.
The agent must deal with realistic challenges such as gravity, velocity control, thruster management, and the risk of crashing or going out of bounds.
Deep Q-Learning Algorithm:

Combines reinforcement learning with deep neural networks to approximate the Q-value function.
The agent learns the optimal actions required for different states to maximize cumulative rewards.
Reinforcement Learning Concepts:

# State Space: Includes the following variables:
Lander's position (x, y)
Velocity (vx, vy)
Orientation (angle, angular velocity)
Leg contact indicators with the landing pad

# Action Space: Discrete actions include:
Firing the main thruster
Firing the left thruster
Firing the right thruster
Taking no action
Reward Function:
Positive rewards for safe landings.
Penalties for crashes, going off-screen, or excessive fuel consumption.

# Neural Network Architecture:

Input Layer: Takes the current state vector.
Hidden Layers: Multiple fully connected layers to learn features from the state space.
Output Layer: Outputs Q-values for all possible actions.

# Key Techniques:

Gymnasium API: Provides a seamless interface for environment interaction and state management.
Experience Replay: Stores past experiences in memory, allowing the agent to train using mini-batches for improved stability.
Target Network: Helps stabilize the learning process by providing fixed Q-value targets for periodic updates.
Exploration vs Exploitation: Balances the trade-off using an epsilon-greedy approach.

# Implementation Steps:
Setup the Lunar Lander Environment:
Install and configure the Gymnasium library and load the LunarLander-v2 environment.
Verify proper interaction between the agent and the environment.

Design and Implement the Neural Network:
Use frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch to build a feedforward neural network.
The network predicts Q-values for all discrete actions based on the state input.

Integrate Deep Q-Learning with Gymnasium:
Train the agent using the Bellman equation to update Q-values.
Use Gymnasium's API for environment resets, actions, and reward feedback during episodes.

Training Loop:
Initialize replay memory and define key hyperparameters (learning rate, gamma, epsilon decay).
Run episodes to train the agent, using the Gymnasium environment for real-time feedback.
Update the target network periodically.

Evaluation and Visualization:
Test the trained agent in unseen scenarios and analyze performance metrics such as landing success rate and fuel efficiency.
Use Gymnasium visualization tools to demonstrate the lunar lander in action.

Expected Outcomes:
A trained agent capable of autonomously landing a spacecraft on the lunar surface with optimal fuel usage.
Visual and numerical insights into the agent's performance over time, demonstrating its mastery of the task.
